# Description
Tech-Blog is a simple blogging website using Node.js, Express.js, Express Session, MySQL, Sequelize, Dotenv, and Handlebar.js. This application shows recent blogs and comments but requires users to sign up or login before the user can comment, create, edit, or delete their own posts. Standard RESTful CRUD oprations are used for posts. The application is live using Heroku and JAWSDB and can be viewed [here](https://murmuring-temple-56417.herokuapp.com/).
